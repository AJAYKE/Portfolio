I'm a software developer and I think software is the greatest collaborative art in the world. I would like to learn as much as I can about this incredible artform. I want to understand all the components involved in making software what it is.

So, I started my jourey with software in Jul 2023, initially worked on frontend, then moved to backend, then on ETL pipelines and now currently working on setting up a kubernetes cluster ground up.
